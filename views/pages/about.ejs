                Puckiq is the result of a series of conversations Ganesh Murdashwar (GMoney - <a href="https://twitter.com/OilersNerdAlert">@OilersNerdAlert</a>) and Darcy McLeod (<a href="https://twitter.com/Woodguy55">@Woodguy55</a>) had about Quality of Competition.

                Hockey players will get different results playing against different qualities of players. In order to analyze a player properly it is important to know how often they play against the best NHLers and how often the play against replacement level NHLers as these micro-results will influence the overall results as the accumulate over a season and over a career.

              <p class="text-justify">
                There is no &quot;Generally Accepted&quot; definition of QoC or metric for QoC. Our goal was to identify the players whose overall results are over 1 standard deviation better than the mean (Elite) and the players whose overall results are below 1 standard deviation worse than the mean (Gritensity). The rest are left in the middle.

                Ganesh was the brain behind creating the database for the site and creating all the code for WoodMoney QoC.

                We were beyond lucky to be joined by the very talented Zsolt Munoz (<a href="https://twitter.com/OilFanInYYC">@OilFanInYYC</a>) and Derek Blasutti (<a href="https://twitter.com/dawgbone98">@dawgbone98</a>). Zsolt designed and coded the infrastructure of the site and Derek was the developer.

              <p class="text-justify">
                Zsolt then took the bull by the horns and was both the developer and designed the infrastructure of the this version of PuckIQ.
